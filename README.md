# Customized-Password-Generator
Hello guys! Here is one of my random python codes (not very advanced) I did when I was a beginner. Just wanted to share with you! Why don't you take a quick look!

# Customized Password Generator

This is a Python script that generates customized passwords based on your preferences. You can specify the length and character types (letters, numbers, symbols) to create strong, secure passwords.

## How to Use

The script will ask you a few questions to customize your password:

1.  How long do you want the password to be?
2.  Do you want to include letters? (yes/no)
3.  Do you want to include numbers? (yes/no)
4.  Do you want to include symbols? (yes/no)

After you answer these questions, the script will generate and display your customized password.

## Files

* `CustomizedPasswordGenerator.py`: This is the main Python script that generates the passwords.

## How to Run the Script

1.  **Download the Code:** Download the `CustomizedPasswordGenerator.py` file to a folder on your computer.
2.  **Open a Command Prompt or Terminal:**
    * On Windows, search for "cmd" and open it.
    * On Mac or Linux, open "Terminal."
3.  **Go to the Folder:** Use the `cd` command to go to the folder where you saved the file.
    * For example, if you saved it in a folder called "passwords," type `cd passwords` and press Enter.
4.  **Run the Script:** Type `python CustomizedPasswordGenerator.py` and press Enter.

## Example
How many letters do you want in your password? Enter here:4
How many numbers do you want in your password? Enter here:2
How many symbols do you want in your password? Enter here:1
Your password can be: ' arrj68$ '
